# 🏏 IPL Data Analysis Using SQL  
### Real-World Sports Analytics Project

## 🔍 Project Summary
This project demonstrates my ability to analyze **real-world IPL (Indian Premier League) data** using **SQL** to extract meaningful insights related to team performance, batting trends, boundary analysis, venue conditions, and match outcomes.

The analysis is performed on a relational database containing match-level and ball-by-ball data, simulating how SQL is used in **data analyst roles** for data exploration, aggregation, and decision-making.

## 🚀 Skills Demonstrated
- Advanced SQL querying (JOINs, GROUP BY, CASE, subqueries)
- Data analysis & problem solving
- Working with relational databases
- Data cleaning and correction using SQL
- Insight generation from large datasets
- Visualization-driven storytelling

---

## 🧠 Key Business Questions Answered
- How has **average scoring per match** changed season-wise?
- Is there an **increase in boundary hitting (fours and sixes)**?
- Which **venues are batting-friendly** based on scoring patterns?
- How do pitch and venue conditions impact match outcomes?

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Season-wise analysis shows a rise in average runs per match, indicating increased batting dominance.
- Boundary analysis highlights a growing trend of aggressive and power hitting.
- Certain venues consistently record higher run rates due to flat pitches and favorable conditions.
- SQL proves to be an effective tool for extracting actionable insights from sports data.
